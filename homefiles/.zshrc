# %(!.%F{red}%n%f.%F{green}%n%f)@
#
# Hostname (blue for workstations, purple for servers)
# `echo ${HOSTCOLOR}`%m%f
#
# Git repository and working status, if applicable, in yellow.
# %F{yellow}$(__git_ps1 " `git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2> /dev/null | xargs basename`->%s")%f
#
# If the shell was launched from Vim, display "VIM" in red.
# %F{red}$(vim_badge)%f
#
# Current working directory, no parent directories, use ~ for home.
# %1~
#
# If last command failed, print exit code in red
# %(?..%F{red}%?%f\n)
#
# If normal user, then green "$".  If priveleged user, then red "#".
# %(!.%F{red}#%f.%F{green}$%f)

# Key Bindings
# ============

# Use Emacs key shortcuts (instead of switching them to Vim-style since EDITOR
# is set to vim)
bindkey -e

# This binds the escape sequence that VS Code sends for forward delete to the correct behaviour, instead of interpreting the key as `~`
# See https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/96741#issuecomment-623149392
bindkey "\e[3~" delete-char

# Changing Directories
# ====================

# Don't cycle through possible matches when pressing TAB repeatedly.
unsetopt auto_menu

# If the command is the name of a directory, change to that directory
setopt autocd

# Always push the last directory onto the stack (as if we did pushd)
setopt autopushd

# Completion
# ==========

# Expansion and Globbing
# ======================

# If a pattern for filename generation has no matches, leave it unchanged (like
# bash does)
unsetopt nomatch

# If numeric filenames are matched by a filename generation pattern, sort the
# filenames numerically rather than lexcographically.
setopt numeric_glob_sort

# Using the =~ operator will use Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions from the
# PCRE library instead of the regexp syntax provided by the system libraries.
setopt rematch_pcre

# History
# =======

# Save each command's beginning timestamp and duration to the history file in
# the format: ":beginning time:elapsed seconds;command"
setopt extended_history

# When a history expansion is entered, perform the expansion and reload the
# line into the editing buffer.
setopt hist_verify

# Enables "extended_history" and "inc_append_history" and causes shells to load
# each other's history after every command.
# setopt share_history

# Don't store commands in the history list if the first character on the line
# is a space, or when one of the expanded aliases contains a space.  Note that
# it will stay in internal (not stored on disk) history until the next command
# is entered.
setopt hist_ignore_space

# Input/Output
# ============

# Expand aliases
setopt aliases

# Use the Dvorak keyboard as a basis for examining spelling mistakes.
setopt dvorak

# Print the exit value of programs with non-zero exit status
# setopt print_exit_value

# Do not query the user before executing "rm *" or "rm path/*"
setopt rm_star_silent

# Job Control
# ===========

# List jobs in the long format by default
setopt long_list_jobs

# Report background job status immediately, rather than waiting until just
# before the next prompt.
# setopt notify

# Prompting
# =========

# Treat "%" specially in prompt sequences (to specify special values)
setopt prompt_percent

# Perform parameter expansion, command substitution and arithmetic expansion
# REQUIRED for the Git Prompt substitution stuff to work!
setopt prompt_subst

# Remove any right prompt from display when accepting a command line.
# setopt transient_rprompt

# ZSH-specific aliases
