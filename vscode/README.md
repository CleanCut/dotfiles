# My VS Code Settings

Every so often someone asks me what my colors / settings for VS Code are. When they ask, I update the [`settings.json` file in this directory](./settings.json) and point them to it. ðŸ˜„

Note that I always install the free [Ubuntu Monospace](https://design.ubuntu.com/font) font to use in my editors and terminals.
